    "In this practical session you will implement and train several Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using the Keras framework with a Tensorflow backend. If you are not already familiar with Keras, you can go over the [following tutorial](https://github.com/tueimage/essential-skills/blob/master/keras.md). More detailed information on the different functionalities can be found in the [Keras library documentation](https://keras.io/). \n",

    "Note that for this set of exercise CPU-only Tensorflow is sufficient (i.e. GPU-support is not required but it will make your experiments run faster). If you use the Anaconda Python distribution, it is recommeded to install Tensorflow via the conda package manager: `conda install tensorflow-cpu`.\n",
